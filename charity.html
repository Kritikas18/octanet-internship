        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are a non-profit organization dedicated to helping those in need. Learn more about our mission and values.Our mission is to support, enable and empower at-risk orphaned children to become self-reliant adults.

            Orphaned children in developing nations are some of the world’s most at-risk people. They are susceptible to disease, illness, poverty and exploitation.
            
            Through our unique model we provide the necessary support for orphaned children to become self-reliant adults.
            
            We’re non-profit and non-denominational and take children of any race, gender and physical or mental ability.Every child has the right to a safe, stable, and permanent home. And yet millions of children remain in orphanages, are removed from their birth family, or are moved too often between foster homes. It’s time to change this. Here’s how we’re doing it.</p>

        <h2>Our Projects</h2>
        <p>Discover the projects we're currently working on and find out how you can contribute.Our team has more than two decades experience helping connect people just like you with opportunities to serve and care for orphaned and vulnerable children. Together with our supporters, we help provide education, food, medical care and emotional healing to 10,000 children and their families each year. Coming alongside local churches, ministries and organizations in countries around the world, we offer professional expertise, help fund their efforts, and supply much needed volunteer support. With our ministry programs, we empower local leaders — those who understand their communities best and know what their people truly need — to do even more to restore hope.Miracle Foundation is an international nonprofit that helps orphans and foster children find a safe, stable, and permanent family. Whether in an orphanage or in the Foster Care System, our vision is a family for every child in our lifetime.

            Since 2000, Miracle Foundation has been dedicated to improving the lives of children. In 2022 alone, we supported more than 170,000 children—and this is just the beginning. Today, we are a world leader in ending the need for orphanages and ensuring children grow up in safe, stable families. To achieve this, we are actively uniting children with families, partnering with frontline workers, preventing children from entering the system whenever possible, and stabilizing placements for children until they find a forever family.
